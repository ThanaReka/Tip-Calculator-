Summary:

- State in an app is any value that can change over time.

- The Composition is a description of the UI built by Compose when it executes composables. 
Compose apps call composable functions to transform data into UI.

- Initial composition is a creation of the UI by Compose when it executes composable functions the first time.

- Recomposition is the process of running the same composables again to update the tree when their data changes.

- State hoisting is a pattern of moving state to its caller to make a component stateless.
